Cleaning Frequency App: When cleaning the house I forget when was the last time I cleaned. 

Create a room that persists in MongoDB. On click it updates the date which signifies that you cleaned that room
 and you can retreive a log that shows what dates you cleaned a room and the average of how often you have been 
cleaning that particular room.
-8/2/20 Delete Route and UI
-8/3/20 Create Put Route to update your date of cleaning. 
-8/3/20 added my own date helper function to format date to show AM PM and 0 for single numbers hours and mins.
